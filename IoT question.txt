You are to design an IoT solution for a new air quality device. The device will be placed
outside and for simplicity we assume it only consists of a set of environmental sensors, a
communication unit and an MCU. (MCU and coms can be the same chip). We are still in the
R&D phase, and will need to be able to update the device firmware in the field.
Questions:
A. What technology would you use for communication / MCU and why?
B. How would you update the firmware?
C. What would be the core challenge(s) with rolling out thousands of devices?
D. What platform/solution(s) would you use for fleet management and why?
Weâ€™d like to offer data from the devices to other platforms, be it IFTTT or integrated with
smart home solutions.
Questions:
E. How would you expose data to other platforms?
F. What are the key challenges with integrating with other platforms?
